It was the ideal location to attract NiaMedic’s target\ndemographic: seniors. Saddleback is nestled in the rolling hills of a region\nsurrounded by at least 15 retirement communities, including the over\n18,000-resident Laguna Woods Village. But the patients who come through\nNiaMedic’s doors generally start with the same question: Can marijuana help?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“The\nshort answer is yes,” said Alon Blatt, NiaMedic’s director of business\ndevelopment. “The constant pain, the arthritis, the fatigue, the trouble\nsleeping, the anxiety—we see cannabis help with all of these.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As\nlegalization of cannabis has spread across the country, the stigma and\nsuspicions around using marijuana for therapeutic purposes have begun to\nfade—even among older people. Eleven states allow anyone over 21 to purchase\npot and another 22 permit medical use with a physician’s recommendation.\nBetween 2006 and 2013, the percentage of those over 65 reporting cannabis use\nin the past year rose nationally to 3% from 0.4%, according to a study\npublished in 2017 in the journal Addiction, while the rates among people aged\n50 to 64 rose to 9% from 2.8%. Although marijuana use is still much more common\namong millennials, older folks represent a growing portion of consumers, a\ntrend that cannabis investors hope will continue as more baby boomers retire.\nAccording to BDS Analytics, a market research firm for the cannabis industry,\n18% of marijuana users nationwide are baby boomers; in states with legal,\nadult-use markets, 21% of boomers have consumed cannabis in the past six\nmonths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in the quasi-legal, for-profit\nmedical weed industry, where peer-reviewed clinical studies are scarce and\nfederal prohibition has prevented the Food and Drug Administration from\nproviding much oversight, there are no clear guidelines on how many milligrams\nand which mix of cannabis compounds might work best for any given ailment. Most\nresearch involves mice instead of humans. Medical students rarely get taught\nabout the potential benefits of cannabis. Many doctors are reluctant to suggest\nmarijuana to their patients. Those who do risk losing federal research funding\nor the license to study and prescribe other controlled substances.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Filling the void is a cottage\nindustry of cannabis-friendly doctors, ready to give patients with a qualifying\ncondition the go-ahead to enter a pot store. At dispensaries, salespeople often\ntake on the task of advising sick people on what and how much to take.\nBusinesses must avoid making claims about weed’s ability to cure or treat a\ndisease, rendering the whole process a confusing dance for the patient,\nsupported by little solid information and requiring trial and error.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s where NiaMedic comes in. Their clinics aim to offer\nsomething unusual and particularly appealing to seniors and their caregivers:\nan evidence-based bridge between the scientists doing marijuana research and\nthe consumers buying legal marijuana. The company does not sell its own\nmarijuana or have a financial interest in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-marijuana-madness-its-like-the-internet-in-1997-1537718400?mod=article_inline\">the\nbusinesses that do</a>. Instead, NiaMedic offers customized cannabis treatment plans\nbased on the few clinical trials that have been done on cannabis as well as the\ncompany’s own internal data from over 10,000 patients, going back nearly a\ndecade. Founded outside Tel Aviv in 2016, NiaMedic now has about a dozen\nmedical staff members at three clinics worldwide—two in Israel and one in\nBeverly Hills. (The Laguna Woods location’s lease expired but it’s set to\nreopen in a nearby town.) NiaMedic expects to open several more U.S. clinics in\nthe next year, including on the East Coast, and has begun to offer video\nconsultations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>What has been your experience (or that of someone close to you)\nwith medical marijuana?

They try to help people manage an array of diseases,\nmedications and complaints while avoiding a disorienting “high.” Doctors and\nnurses test patients’ balance. They ask about diet. They talk about the\npatient’s home, and suggest getting rid of carpets and rugs, because older\npeople tend to drag their feet, and carpets can lead to falls.

The little research that exists about cannabis and its compounds—such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which gets you high, or the non-intoxicating cannabidiol (CBD)—has mostly been done in animals or overseas. Much of the medical advice about marijuana, from dosage to strain to delivery method, is not based on rigorous studies in humans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":52} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://cannabis-collaboration.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-52\"/><figcaption>For decades, marijuana’s illegality has made doing clinical trials on the plant’s medical benefits nearly impossible. PHOTO: JULIO CORTEZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS </figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While prescription drugs must be\napproved by the FDA, the federal prohibition against pot means the cannabis\nindustry operates in a grey area, and is therefore harder to hold to any\nmedical standards. Some states have tightly regulated medical marijuana\nmarkets, but there are also marijuana oils that claim to cure cancer and\ndispensary workers known as “budtenders” who could suggest something that\nresults in a two-day high. NiaMedic says it is one of only a handful of\norganizations and businesses that have amassed enough private data to provide\nmedical cannabis patients with detailed recommendations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The company’s co-founder, Inbal\nSikorin, began treating patients with marijuana about a decade ago, as the head\nnurse at a nursing home on the Kibbutz Na’an near Rehovot, Israel. (She said\nshe was inspired by a documentary about Raphael Mechoulam, the Israel-based\nscientist who discovered in 1964 that THC is the cannabinoid that causes a\n“high.”) Medical marijuana had been legal in Israel since 1994, though access\nonly began to expand significantly in 2002. After partnering with one of\nIsrael’s licensed medical-cannabis growers, Tikun Olam, in 2010, Ms. Sikorin\nbegan tracking her patients’ outcomes, collecting information that led to the\nsystem of protocols that her company uses today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“We’re not claiming to cure any\ndiseases. We’re trying to manage the symptoms, to improve quality of life,”\nsaid Mr. Blatt. “The bulk of the work is case management.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the initial appointment, the patient or caregiver will go\nto a local dispensary to purchase products with the recommended strength and\nmixture of ingredients. (NiaMedic keeps tabs on which local shops have what\nproducts to better advise patients about what is available, but it does not\nrefer them to specific dispensaries.) NiaMedic’s nurses then spend about a\nmonth checking in with patients over the phone and slowly toggling the dosage\nand delivery method of the cannabis until the patient’s treatment goals are\nachieved. Many of the older patients are afraid of feeling stoned, so NiaMedic’s\nrecommendations typically cover relatively low doses of THC, as well as\nnon-intoxicating cannabinoids like CBD, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/prepare-for-a-wave-of-cannabis-productsbeyond-cbd-1540479300?mod=article_inline\">the plant’s\nmany other compounds</a>, provided they are available at dispensaries. Only 6% of their\npatients report feeling light-headed, or high, the company said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Access to this kind of service, and to medical cannabis in\ngeneral, remains out of reach for most seniors. Consultations with NiaMedic\ncost $350. Patients with Medicare pay only $100 out-of-pocket for the cannabis\nportion of the appointment. A similar consultation with a data-oriented medical\ncannabis company in California called Calla Spring Wellness costs $200 or $300,\ndepending on whether you speak with a doctor or a nurse. Marijuana products\nthemselves&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-cannabis-industrys-luxury-rebranding-11557946556?mod=article_inline\">might cost\nabout $50 a month</a>, and are not covered by insurance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In places with wealthier aging populations, some pot firms have been eager to market to older people. Trulieve, which has 29 medical marijuana shops in Florida, says its average customer is over 50.

Could this be associated with falls?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other people who work with seniors\nexpressed concern that in the absence of accurate dosage information, cannabis\nbusinesses have a financial incentive to recommend a patient take a higher dose\nthan they might actually need.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“One does not want to leave it to\nan individual or a dispensary to determine how much THC or CBD a person is\ntaking,” said Daniel Reingold, the president of Hebrew Home at Riverdale, an\nassisted living facility in New York City. Mr. Reingold decided to allow\ncannabis on premises after the state legalized medical marijuana use in 2014.\nNow, about a dozen of his 735 residents have obtained medical marijuana recommendations,\nand all have seen some benefit, he said. But it’s not ideal: “Scientific data\nneeds to be available and promulgated and disseminated so practitioners can\nknow how to use the drug to help people,” he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many older folks remain\nuncomfortable with the drug and with breaking federal law, even if weed has\nbeen legalized in their state.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“People over 55 still have the\nlargest percentage of what we’d call cannabis rejecters: they don’t consume,\nnor are they open to it,” said Jessica Lukas, vice president of consumer\ninsights at BDS Analytics. That “rejecter” percentage is higher among African-American\nand Hispanic populations, said Sue Taylor, a retired Catholic-school principal\nturned cannabis activist for the elderly. “That’s who they incarcerate first,\nand they don’t forget it.

It was the ideal location to attract NiaMedic’s target\ndemographic: seniors. Saddleback is nestled in the rolling hills of a region\nsurrounded by at least 15 retirement communities, including the over\n18,000-resident Laguna Woods Village. But the patients who come through\nNiaMedic’s doors generally start with the same question: Can marijuana help?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“The\nshort answer is yes,” said Alon Blatt, NiaMedic’s director of business\ndevelopment. “The constant pain, the arthritis, the fatigue, the trouble\nsleeping, the anxiety—we see cannabis help with all of these.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As\nlegalization of cannabis has spread across the country, the stigma and\nsuspicions around using marijuana for therapeutic purposes have begun to\nfade—even among older people. Eleven states allow anyone over 21 to purchase\npot and another 22 permit medical use with a physician’s recommendation.\nBetween 2006 and 2013, the percentage of those over 65 reporting cannabis use\nin the past year rose nationally to 3% from 0.4%, according to a study\npublished in 2017 in the journal Addiction, while the rates among people aged\n50 to 64 rose to 9% from 2.8%. Although marijuana use is still much more common\namong millennials, older folks represent a growing portion of consumers, a\ntrend that cannabis investors hope will continue as more baby boomers retire.\nAccording to BDS Analytics, a market research firm for the cannabis industry,\n18% of marijuana users nationwide are baby boomers; in states with legal,\nadult-use markets, 21% of boomers have consumed cannabis in the past six\nmonths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But in the quasi-legal, for-profit\nmedical weed industry, where peer-reviewed clinical studies are scarce and\nfederal prohibition has prevented the Food and Drug Administration from\nproviding much oversight, there are no clear guidelines on how many milligrams\nand which mix of cannabis compounds might work best for any given ailment. Most\nresearch involves mice instead of humans. Medical students rarely get taught\nabout the potential benefits of cannabis. Many doctors are reluctant to suggest\nmarijuana to their patients. Those who do risk losing federal research funding\nor the license to study and prescribe other controlled substances.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Filling the void is a cottage\nindustry of cannabis-friendly doctors, ready to give patients with a qualifying\ncondition the go-ahead to enter a pot store. At dispensaries, salespeople often\ntake on the task of advising sick people on what and how much to take.\nBusinesses must avoid making claims about weed’s ability to cure or treat a\ndisease, rendering the whole process a confusing dance for the patient,\nsupported by little solid information and requiring trial and error.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s where NiaMedic comes in. Their clinics aim to offer\nsomething unusual and particularly appealing to seniors and their caregivers:\nan evidence-based bridge between the scientists doing marijuana research and\nthe consumers buying legal marijuana. The company does not sell its own\nmarijuana or have a financial interest in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-marijuana-madness-its-like-the-internet-in-1997-1537718400?mod=article_inline\">the\nbusinesses that do</a>. Instead, NiaMedic offers customized cannabis treatment plans\nbased on the few clinical trials that have been done on cannabis as well as the\ncompany’s own internal data from over 10,000 patients, going back nearly a\ndecade. Founded outside Tel Aviv in 2016, NiaMedic now has about a dozen\nmedical staff members at three clinics worldwide—two in Israel and one in\nBeverly Hills. (The Laguna Woods location’s lease expired but it’s set to\nreopen in a nearby town.) NiaMedic expects to open several more U.S. clinics in\nthe next year, including on the East Coast, and has begun to offer video\nconsultations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4><strong>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</strong></h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>What has been your experience (or that of someone close to you)\nwith medical marijuana?

They try to help people manage an array of diseases,\nmedications and complaints while avoiding a disorienting “high.” Doctors and\nnurses test patients’ balance. They ask about diet. They talk about the\npatient’s home, and suggest getting rid of carpets and rugs, because older\npeople tend to drag their feet, and carpets can lead to falls. If someone has a\nhistory of certain severe cardiac or psychiatric issues, NiaMedic’s doctors\nwon’t recommend cannabis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NiaMedic said an internal study\ncovering just over 100 elderly cases shows that 93.8% of patients “reported\nimprovement in their condition,” and more than half stopped using opioids or\nother painkillers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“I never wanted to try any of this\nstuff. I was very skeptical,’” said Mary Perini, 58, who was referred to\nNiaMedic in December by a doctor at Los Angeles’s Cedars-Sinai medical center,\nfor severe chronic pain from two car accidents. “Since getting on NiaMedic,\nI’ve been able to walk with my walker down the block and back, and I haven’t\nbeen able to do that for years,” she said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. Benjamin Han, a geriatrician\nand assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine, said he began hearing\nquestions from his patients about medical marijuana about five years ago.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“The two main things are pain and\nsleep,” Dr. Han said. “The problem is that we really don’t have much research\nin this area.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For decades, marijuana’s illegality has made doing clinical trials on the plant’s medical benefits nearly impossible. The little research that exists about cannabis and its compounds—such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which gets you high, or the non-intoxicating cannabidiol (CBD)—has mostly been done in animals or overseas. Much of the medical advice about marijuana, from dosage to strain to delivery method, is not based on rigorous studies in humans.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":52} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://cannabis-collaboration.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-52\"/><figcaption>For decades, marijuana’s illegality has made doing clinical trials on the plant’s medical benefits nearly impossible. PHOTO: JULIO CORTEZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS </figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While prescription drugs must be\napproved by the FDA, the federal prohibition against pot means the cannabis\nindustry operates in a grey area, and is therefore harder to hold to any\nmedical standards. Some states have tightly regulated medical marijuana\nmarkets, but there are also marijuana oils that claim to cure cancer and\ndispensary workers known as “budtenders” who could suggest something that\nresults in a two-day high. NiaMedic says it is one of only a handful of\norganizations and businesses that have amassed enough private data to provide\nmedical cannabis patients with detailed recommendations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The company’s co-founder, Inbal\nSikorin, began treating patients with marijuana about a decade ago, as the head\nnurse at a nursing home on the Kibbutz Na’an near Rehovot, Israel. (She said\nshe was inspired by a documentary about Raphael Mechoulam, the Israel-based\nscientist who discovered in 1964 that THC is the cannabinoid that causes a\n“high.”) Medical marijuana had been legal in Israel since 1994, though access\nonly began to expand significantly in 2002. After partnering with one of\nIsrael’s licensed medical-cannabis growers, Tikun Olam, in 2010, Ms. Sikorin\nbegan tracking her patients’ outcomes, collecting information that led to the\nsystem of protocols that her company uses today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“We’re not claiming to cure any\ndiseases. We’re trying to manage the symptoms, to improve quality of life,”\nsaid Mr. Blatt. “The bulk of the work is case management.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the initial appointment, the patient or caregiver will go\nto a local dispensary to purchase products with the recommended strength and\nmixture of ingredients. (NiaMedic keeps tabs on which local shops have what\nproducts to better advise patients about what is available, but it does not\nrefer them to specific dispensaries.) NiaMedic’s nurses then spend about a\nmonth checking in with patients over the phone and slowly toggling the dosage\nand delivery method of the cannabis until the patient’s treatment goals are\nachieved. Many of the older patients are afraid of feeling stoned, so NiaMedic’s\nrecommendations typically cover relatively low doses of THC, as well as\nnon-intoxicating cannabinoids like CBD, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/prepare-for-a-wave-of-cannabis-productsbeyond-cbd-1540479300?mod=article_inline\">the plant’s\nmany other compounds</a>, provided they are available at dispensaries. Only 6% of their\npatients report feeling light-headed, or high, the company said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Access to this kind of service, and to medical cannabis in\ngeneral, remains out of reach for most seniors. Consultations with NiaMedic\ncost $350. Patients with Medicare pay only $100 out-of-pocket for the cannabis\nportion of the appointment. A similar consultation with a data-oriented medical\ncannabis company in California called Calla Spring Wellness costs $200 or $300,\ndepending on whether you speak with a doctor or a nurse. Marijuana products\nthemselves&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-cannabis-industrys-luxury-rebranding-11557946556?mod=article_inline\">might cost\nabout $50 a month</a>, and are not covered by insurance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In places with wealthier aging populations, some pot firms have been eager to market to older people. Trulieve, which has 29 medical marijuana shops in Florida, says its average customer is over 50. The company often holds educational events at assisted living homes and opened a call center to connect with seniors offline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":53} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"http://cannabis-collaboration.local/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-53\"/><figcaption>Trulieve has 29 medical marijuana shops in Florida, including this one in Tampa, photographed in 2017. PHOTO: JAMES BORCHUCK/ZUMA PRESS </figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“They want that human interaction,\nrather than just opening a laptop,” says Trulieve Chief Executive Kim Rivers.\nTo help patients better determine what to buy and how much to take, the company\nencourages them to consult with their doctors and to keep a diary of what\nproducts they took, how they felt and how that changes. Trulieve also created a\nportal where doctors who write cannabis recommendations can browse medical\njournal articles about marijuana’s effects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NYU’s Dr. Han remains apprehensive\nabout the limited nature of existing research. Seniors around the country might\nbe experimenting with cannabis and becoming too intoxicated, he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“A lot of what I do as a\ngeriatrician is taking care of old people who have many chronic diseases,\nprobably take a lot of medicines, and are really vulnerable to the adverse\neffects. A common thing [for older patients trying marijuana] is they get\ndizzy,” he said. “That makes me worried. Could this be associated with falls?”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other people who work with seniors\nexpressed concern that in the absence of accurate dosage information, cannabis\nbusinesses have a financial incentive to recommend a patient take a higher dose\nthan they might actually need.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“One does not want to leave it to\nan individual or a dispensary to determine how much THC or CBD a person is\ntaking,” said Daniel Reingold, the president of Hebrew Home at Riverdale, an\nassisted living facility in New York City. Mr. Reingold decided to allow\ncannabis on premises after the state legalized medical marijuana use in 2014.\nNow, about a dozen of his 735 residents have obtained medical marijuana recommendations,\nand all have seen some benefit, he said. But it’s not ideal: “Scientific data\nneeds to be available and promulgated and disseminated so practitioners can\nknow how to use the drug to help people,” he said.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many older folks remain\nuncomfortable with the drug and with breaking federal law, even if weed has\nbeen legalized in their state.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“People over 55 still have the\nlargest percentage of what we’d call cannabis rejecters: they don’t consume,\nnor are they open to it,” said Jessica Lukas, vice president of consumer\ninsights at BDS Analytics. That “rejecter” percentage is higher among African-American\nand Hispanic populations, said Sue Taylor, a retired Catholic-school principal\nturned cannabis activist for the elderly. “That’s who they incarcerate first,\nand they don’t forget it. Many of them will not touch it still because it’s\nfederally illegal.” Ms. Taylor plans to open a senior-oriented pot shop and\neducation center in Berkeley, Calif., in the next few months, across from a\nclinic for people over 60.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several marijuana companies are\npartnering with universities and researchers to make some of their information\npublic.
